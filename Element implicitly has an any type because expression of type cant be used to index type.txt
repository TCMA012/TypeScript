const someObj:ObjectType = data;
const field = 'username';

// This gives an error
const temp = someObj[field];

// Solution 1: When the type of the object is known
const temp = someObj[field as keyof ObjectType]

// Solution 2: When the type of the object is not known
const temp = someObj[field as keyof typeof someObj]
