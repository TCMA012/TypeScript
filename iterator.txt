TypeScript iterable iterator
 
https://inspirnathan.com/posts/23-iterators-iterables-and-generators/
the square brackets around the property name, "Symbol.iterator," is known as a computed property name. This lets us use dots/periods inside the property name. Additionally, we can insert variables or evaluate expressions to generate dynamic property names.

an @@iterator method is identical to the Symbol.iterator method. 
The @@ symbols are used to denote common symbols in the official ECMAScript specification.
