How not to learn TypeScript
https://fettblog.eu/how-not-to-learn-typescript/
If your code needs to use one of the following keywords, you’re probably either in the wrong corner of TypeScript, or much further than you want to be:

namespace
declare
module
<reference>
abstract
unique
This doesn’t mean that those keywords don’t contribute something very important and are necessary for a variety of use-cases. When learning TypeScript, you don’t want to work with them at the beginning, though.
