The Empty Object Type in TypeScript

The empty object type
{}
Instead of representing an empty object, it represents any value except null and undefined.
This is because TypeScript's type system is structural, not nominal. Everything except null and undefined is an object, so everything can be assigned to an empty object.

If you want to represent an empty object, use Record<string, never> instead.
