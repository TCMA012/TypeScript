type UnwrapPromise<P> = P extends PromiseLike<infer T> ? T : P;

the main reason that we have PromiseLike is that several implementations were available before the native one was supported (such as bluebird, Promises/A+, jQuery, and more).
In order for typescript to work with code bases that are using those implementations there must be a type other than Promise, otherwise there would be a lot of contradictions.
